                        Back in 2016, Mauri Tapia and Chaisson Nuusolia were just students at Pacifica High School in Oxnard, California. They met in jazz band and played any song that came to mind.
                        However, what blossomed after was something neither could have ever expected.<br><br>
                        Their casual group later became one of the defining staples of the indie and pop music industry.<br>
                        As a first-generation Mexican-American and the face of <b>Los Retros</b>, Mauri was inspired by music that originated in Central and South America during the 70s and 80s.
                        Mauri sought to recapture the sounds of his youth - music that his parents would put on that connected Mauri to his roots.

                                Their debut album under the name Los Retros, <b>Looking Back</b> is a collection of songs that 
                                quite literally looks back at the band's early days. The discography is comprised of songs made within 
                                the band's first year, some of which are also available on <b>Retrospect (2017)</b>. With each song being 
                                a nostalgic trip down memory lane, <b>Looking Back</b> conveys the importance of acknowledging the past 
                                to understand the present.

                            A defining project for Los Retros, <b>Everlasting</b> marks a metamorphosis in their formula for music. 
                            Released during the first months of the pandemic, Mauri describes the EP as a "message to the generations in the end times."
                            While it seems to have a pessimistic undertone, the EP itself describes the process of finding hope in a world filled with sin.
                            Mauri references his own beliefs to further impart this philosophy and while different than their past works, <b>Everlasting</b> is critical
                            for the message Los Retros wants to send to the world.

                            The debut EP of Los Retros, <b>Retrospect</b> offer six songs of whimsical melodies and sounds 
                            reminiscent of the <i>romanticas</i> of a previous generation. Fittingly, many of the songs included touch upon the complicated 
                            feeling that is love and Mauri's journey through life. While released when he was just out of high school, <b>Retrospect</b> conveys
                            deep-cutting emotions anyone can resonate with.

                            Before taking upon the name Los Retros, the group was simply known as Retrospect. 
                            However, after potential legal conflicts over the rights to the name, 
                            Mauri decided to modify it to be more accurate and faithful to their content.
                            While a beneficial change in identity, fans of Los Retros must experience <b>Retrospect (2017)</b> for hidden gems and 
                            a blast to the past.
